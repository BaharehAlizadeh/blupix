# Blupix Project

Thank you for using BluPix! The photos you take and share on our crowdsourcing applications will help your community better document and understand the impact of floods in your area. Our models compare pre-flood and post-flood photos of the same location to estimate the depth of floodwater in that particular location. We use traffic signs as benchmarks since their shapes and sizes are standardized anywhere in the country. With your help, BluPix will assist communities and disaster response teams in mitigating flood risk, which saves lives, resources, and infrastructure.

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Blupix app  | A crowdsourcing application for collecting photos of flooded stop signs. This app uses AI algorithms to calculate flood depth based on the size of stop signs and generate a flood depth map. | [https://blupix.geos.tamu.edu/]
| Blupix Preflood  | A crowdsourcing application for collecting pre-flood photos of stop signs. | [https://blupix-image.geos.tamu.edu/]
| Blupix Mobile  | A mobile app for real-time flood depth estimation in urban areas | [https://github.com/ciber-lab/blupix/tree/main/blupix-mobile]
| Blupix Dataset  | Annotated photos of stop signs before and after flood | [https://github.com/ciber-lab/blupix/tree/main/blupix-dataset]

# Blupix Project

Thank you for using BluPix! The photos you take and share on our crowdsourcing applications will help your community better document and understand the impact of floods in your area. Our models compare pre-flood and post-flood photos of the same location to estimate the depth of floodwater in that particular location. We use traffic signs as benchmarks since their shapes and sizes are standardized anywhere in the country. With your help, BluPix will assist communities and disaster response teams in mitigating flood risk, which saves lives, resources, and infrastructure.

| Blupix app  | A crowdsourcing application for collecting photos of flooded stop signs. This app uses AI algorithms to calculate flood depth based on the size of stop signs and generate a flood depth map. | [https://blupix.geos.tamu.edu/]
| Blupix Preflood  | A crowdsourcing application for collecting photos of stop signs. | [https://blupix-image.geos.tamu.edu/]
| Blupix Mobile  | A mobile app for real-time flood depth estimation in urban areas. | [https://github.com/ciber-lab/blupix/tree/main/blupix-mobile]
| Blupix Dataset  | Annotated photos of stop signs before and after flood. | [https://github.com/ciber-lab/blupix/tree/main/blupix-dataset]


## The connection between Blupix app, Blupix Mobile app, and Blupix Preflood app:

In this design, the Blupix app serves as the main platform, accessible via a dedicated website [https://blupix.geos.tamu.edu], where people can upload photos of flooded traffic signs using their mobile devices or computers. Users can manually pair uploaded photos with corresponding pre-flood photos by entering the location of the traffic sign in GSV. The app admin reviews uploaded photos, and subsequently feeds them to a computer vision model for further analysis. The output of this step is the estimate of flood depth, which is also reported on the map alongside the pre- and post-flood photos of the stop sign. Given an uploaded photo pair, if only the post-flood photo is approved by the admin, only the post-flood photo will be pinned on the map which can be paired with the correct pre-flood photo later by the same or other users.
Blupix Mobile, on the other hand, is a mobile app that enables users to take a photo of a flooded traffic sign while the app automatically pairs it with the GSV view of the same traffic sign using GPS and accelerometer data of the mobile device. Upon the completion of the pairing process (which takes only a few seconds), the mobile app provides instant flood depth information through its built-in computer vision model. Users can also upload their paired photo with the calculated flood depth to a cloud database, which is then reviewed by the admin and  pinned on the map. The Blupix Mobile app is available for Android devices and can be downloaded from the research labâ€™s GitHub page [https://github.com/ciber-lab/blupix/tree/main/blupix-mobile].
Finally, Blupix Preflood is a crowdsourcing app for collecting pre-flood photos of stop signs prior to a flood event, accessible via a website [https://blupix-image.geos.tamu.edu]. Collecting pre-flood photos is useful for future pairing with post-flood photos in locations with limited GSV data or mobile data connectivity interruptions during floods. User-uploaded photos on this app are stored on a cloud database and pinned on the map as pre-flood photos. The app extracts the geospatial metadata of the uploaded photo (if any) to automatically populate the location field. If the metadata is not available, users should enter the location of the photo in the app. The app admin reviews all uploaded photos before they are pinned on the map.
